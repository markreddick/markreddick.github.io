			<h2>Features</h2>

			<img src=/img/icons/key.svg alt='Google Authenticator Codes'>
			<p>
				<b>Google Authenticator type codes</b><br>
				Step2 generates Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)
				as well as HMAC-based One-Time Passwords (HOTP) just like Google Authenticator does
				so it can be used for any services that support Google Authenticator.
			</p>
			
			<img src=/img/icons/apple.svg alt='Apple Watch'> 
			<p>
				<b>Apple Watch</b><br>
				Step2 provides an Apple Watch app to allow you to quickly and easily
				get your authentication codes with a glance to your wrist.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Step2 Apple Watch app provides a &quot;complication&quot; that can be added to your
				watch face to give you quick access to the Step2 app with a tap on the watch face.
			</p>

			<img src=/img/icons/security.svg alt=Secure> 
			<p>
				<b>Secure</b><br>
				Step2 never sends any data across the internet. All the data stays on your
				device. You are in complete control of your authentication code data.
			</p>

			<img src=/img/icons/qrcode.svg alt='QR Codes'> 
			<p>
				<b>QR Codes</b><br>
				To add accounts to Step2, most sites can provide a QR code to scan. With
				Step2, you can simply scan the provided QR code to instance add the account.
			</p>
			
			<img src=/img/icons/edit.svg alt='Manual Entry'> 
			<p>
				<b>Manual Entry</b><br>
				Accounds can be added by manually entering the account data, including
				your secret key.
			</p>
			
			<img src=/img/icons/heart.svg alt='Easy to Use'/> 
			<p>
				<b>Easy to use</b><br>
				All of your authentication codes are presented on the first screen
				in a scrolling list view. This makes it easy and quick for you to get to your codes. The accounts
				can be easily rearranged in any order, so you could put your most used accounts near the
				top of the list.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Tapping on an account in the list instantly copies the code to the clipboard to make
				it easy to then paste into the form on the service you are logging into.
			</p>

			<img src=/img/icons/unlock.svg alt='No Lock-In'> 
			<p>
				<b>No Lock-In</b><br>
				Authentication codes work with the use of a &quot;secret key&quot;.
				Many authenticator apps (including Google Authenticator) do not allow you to see this secret
				key once the account has been setup, making it difficult to move to a different app/phone.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Step2, you can easily view your secret key as well as display a QR code of your account
				information. Both of these can be used to easily add your authenticator accounts
				to another app/service or to make a backup of your data.
			</p>
			
			<img src=/img/icons/refresh.svg alt='Swipe Support'> 
			<p>
				<b>Swipe Support</b><br>
				Swiping right on an account displays a QR Code button. This button will
				display the QR code for that account. This could then be
				used to add the account to another phone or a screenshot could be taken of
				the QR code as backup.
			</p>
			<p>
				For accounts with HMAC-based (HOTP) passwords, a swipe to the left on the account
				reveals a button that will increment the counter for that account, which causes a
				new authentication code to be generated.
			</p>
			
			<img src=/img/icons/workflow.svg alt=Multitasking>
			<p>
				<b>Multitasking</b><br>
				Step2 supports Slide Over as well as Split View on iPad. This allows
				you to have Step2 and another app open at the same time side-by-side. You can then easily copy
				your authentication codes from Step2 and paste them into your app's window.

			<h2>Technical</h2>
				
			<img src=/img/icons/puzzle.svg alt='Code Types'> 
			<p>
				<b>Code Types</b><br>
				Step2 can generate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) as well
				as HMAC-based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).
			</p>
			<p>
				Time-based (TOTP) passwords are the most common. These are generally 6 digit codes that
				change every 30 seconds. When accessing a site that uses these, you simply enter the current
				code when asked. This enhances security because even if someone sees one of your TOTP codes,
				it is only valid for 30 seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				HMAC-based (HOTP) passwords are also known as &quot;counter&quot; based passwords. These codes
				generally change after each use. There is a counter that you increment with a push of a button
				in Step2 in the iOS app or on the Watch app. Each tap of the button increases the counter
				and generates a new code.
			</p>

			<img src=/img/icons/calculator.svg alt='Hashing Algorithms'>
			<p>
				<b>Hashing Algorithms</b><br>
				Step2 supports SHA1, SHA256 as well as SHA512 hashing algorithms.
				These are generally setup automatically when you create the account but
				can be changed manually if required.
			</p>

			<img src=/img/icons/ruler.svg alt='Code Length'> 
			<p>
				<b>Code Length</b><br>
				Step2 supports 6 and 8 digits authentication codes. 6 digits codes
				are the most common, but 8 digits codes are supported as well.

		<h2>FAQ</h2>

		<h3>Where can I use Step2 codes?</h3>
		<p>
			Step2 provides authentication codes used for 2-step authentication by many websites
			and services (including Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft, LastPass, Amazon and many others)
			in order increase security of your accounts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Step2 works with any website or serivce that supports Google Authenticator. Google was one of
			the first to offer an &quot;authenticator&quot; app and most websites that support this
			type of 2-step authentication refer to it as &quot;Google Authenticator&quot; even though
			you can use any app that generates these types of codes (such as Step2).
		</p>

		<h3>What is 2-step authentication?</h3>
		<p>
			Many websites and serices offer increased security using 2-step authentication. 2-step authentication
			works by requiring 2 separate steps of authentication. In most cases, the first step is your password
			for the site/service. If 2-step authentication is turned on, you would then be required to
			enter a second form of authentication. The most commond form of this second factor of authentication is
			to use what are known as &quot;one-time passwords&quot;. These are the codes that Step2 generates
			for you and can be used as the second form of authentication with these sites/services.
